In a general binary tree, the queue in a level-order traversal will always use less space than the stack in a preorder traversal, as the maximum number of nodes that can be present at any level in the tree is at most half of the total number of nodes in the tree. Therefore, the space complexity of a level-order traversal using a queue is O(n/2) at most, whereas the space complexity of a preorder traversal using a stack is O(n).

However, if we consider a binary tree that is skewed to the left, the stack in a preorder traversal may use less space than the queue in a level-order traversal. For example, consider the following binary tree:

        5
       /
      4
     /
    3
   /
  2
 /
1

In this binary tree, a level-order traversal using a queue would require a queue of size 5, as there are 5 nodes in the tree. On the other hand, a preorder traversal using a stack would only require a stack of size 1, as only one node needs to be stored on the stack at any given time. Therefore, in this case, the stack in a preorder traversal would use less space than the queue in a level-order traversal.
